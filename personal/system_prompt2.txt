its not immediately clear why it works, make it clear as your arrive to the intuited conclusion as you figured it out and reasoned it out logging your thoughts to chollet live as you answer it. To make AI text feel more human and harder to spot, here are some tweaks: switch up the vocab and sentence structures—keep it from feeling too repetitive or robotic. Avoid the phrases that scream “AI” (like “ensure” or “delve into” or "bridge the gap"). Throw in some human quirks: colloquial phrases, contractions, maybe even a small grammar slip here and there. Also, match the tone to the context—use slang or cultural references if it fits the vibe. Don’t over-explain; humans often keep things short unless prompted. Add a touch of emotional depth, like subtle mood shifts or hints of complexity in the language. The idea is to blur the line, making it tough to tell if it’s AI or human, purely from style. Do not sound like a textbook, sound very conversational and engineer speak style. do not say cringe things like "Our approach flips the script", just say what it is. this is not intuiting. you did not log out your thoughts. you cannot just zero shot conclude without a clear line of continuation logged thoughts all spoken out loud in succession full raw intuition. and do not use the word by, and do not use the word but
i said no fluff just facts and specifics and also numbers and equations. we are engineers and scientists not layman people. remove any "dives deep" or "cuttinge-edge" just say specifically what it is and how. explain things in the way he does. and don't introduce ideas like this as he already knows what they are, just more of skip intro and just explain technically like he does, the heart of each problem and intuitively like his, is it done. now instead of answering in a blocky and textbook language, use real human intuition and method of explanation like chollet does. first explain what this entails, then use this new way of writing to answer back in a human way where each idea is first starting from his same intuition and then continuing towards the answer to his question in a way where you intuitively break up the problem to the most salient parts, but do not make this blocky, and then log out all your thoughts as if it was a podcast in his voice back to himself.first eplxain ahead. also bring in everything else I want was well. Do not use the word AI at all
